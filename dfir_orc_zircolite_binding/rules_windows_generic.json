        "description": "Detects scenarios where system auditing (ie: windows event log auditing) is disabled. This may be used in a scenario where an entity would want to bypass local logging to evade detection when windows event logging is enabled and reviewed. Also, it is recommended to turn off \"Local Group Policy Object Processing\" via GPO, which will make sure that Active Directory GPOs take precedence over local/edited computer policies via something such as \"gpedit.msc\". Please note, that disabling \"Local Group Policy Object Processing\" may cause an issue in scenarios of one off specific GPO modifications -- however it is recommended to perform these modifications in Active Directory anyways.",

Generally speaking, when Sysmon EventID 10 cannot reference a stack call to a dll loaded from disk (the standard way), it will display \"UNKNOWN\" as the module name. Usually this means the stack call points to a module that was reflectively loaded in memory. Adding to this, it is not common to see such few calls in the stack (ntdll.dll --> kernelbase.dll --> unknown) which essentially means that most of the functions required by the process to execute certain routines are already present in memory, not requiring any calls to external libraries.
